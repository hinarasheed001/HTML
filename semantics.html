                    <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t
                        have
                        the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t
                        know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but
                        we
                        understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based
                        on
                        past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s
                        dogs
                        are the perfect example of this.

                        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived
                        from
                        extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were
                        the
                        first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the
                        development of
                        agriculture.
